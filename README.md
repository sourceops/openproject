## Community

OpenProject is driven by an active group of open source enthusiasts: software engineers, project managers, creatives, and consultants. OpenProject is supported by companies as well as individuals. We share the vision to build great open source project collaboration software.
The [OpenProject Foundation (OPF)](https://community.openproject.org/projects/openproject/wiki/OpenProject_Foundation) will give official guidance to the project and the community and oversees contributions and decisions.

## Repository

This repository contains several main branches:

* `dev`: The main development branch. We try to keep it stable in the sense of all tests are passing, but we don't recommend it for production systems.
* `stable/<version>`: Contains the latest stable release for a specific version. We recommend to use this for production use. Example: `stable/4.1`.

## Security / Responsible Disclosure

We take security very seriously at OpenProject. We value any kind of feedback that
will keep our community secure. If you happen to come across a security issue we urge
you to disclose it to us privately to allow our users and community enough time to
upgrade. Security issues will always take precedence over anything else in the pipeline.
