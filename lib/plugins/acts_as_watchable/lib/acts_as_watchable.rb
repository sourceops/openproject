        #
        # This also creates the routes necessary for watching/unwatching by adding the model's name to routes. This
        # e.g leads to the following routes when marking issues as watchable:
        #   POST:     issues/1/watch
        #   DELETE:   issues/1/unwatch
        #   GET/POST: issues/1/watchers/new
        #   DELETE:   issues/1/watchers/1
        # Use the :route_prefix option to change the model prefix, e.g. from issues to tickets
        #
        # params:
        #   options:
        #     route_prefix: overrides the route calculation which would normally use the models name.
