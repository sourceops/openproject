Feature: Localized decimal custom fields can be created

  Background:
    Given I am already admin
    And the following languages are active:
      | en |
      | de |
    When I go to the custom fields page
    When I follow "Create a new custom field" within "#tab-content-WorkPackageCustomField"

  @javascript
  Scenario: Creating a decimal custom field
    When I select "Float" from "custom_field_field_format"
    And I set the english localization of the "name" attribute to "New Field"
    And I set the english localization of the "default_value" attribute to "20.34"
    And I press "Save"
    Then I should be on the custom fields page
