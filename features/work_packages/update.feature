      | firstname | the     |
      | lastname  | manager |
    And the user "manager" has the following preferences
      | warn_on_leaving_unsaved | false |
    And there are the following types:
      | Name   | Is milestone |
      | Phase1 | false        |
      | Phase2 | false        |
    And there are the following project types:
      | Name                  |
      | Standard Project      |
    And there is 1 project with the following:
      | identifier | ecookbook |
      | name       | ecookbook |
    And the project named "ecookbook" is of the type "Standard Project"
    And the following types are enabled for projects of type "Standard Project"
      | Phase1 |
      | Phase2 |
    And there is a role "manager"
    And the role "manager" may have the following rights:
      | edit_work_packages     |
      | view_work_packages     |
      | manage_subtasks        |
      | add_work_package_notes |
    And I am working in project "ecookbook"
    And the user "manager" is a "manager"
    And there are the following priorities:
      | name  | default |
      | prio1 | true    |
      | prio2 |         |
    And there are the following status:
      | name    | default |
      | status1 | true    |
      | status2 |         |
    And the project "ecookbook" has 1 version with the following:
      | name | version1 |
    And the type "Phase1" has the default workflow for the role "manager"
    And the type "Phase2" has the default workflow for the role "manager"
    And there are the following work packages in project "ecookbook":
      | subject | type    | status  | fixed_version |
      | wp1     | Phase1  | status1 | version1      |
    And I am already logged in as "manager"

  @javascript
  Scenario: On a work package with children a user should not be able to change attributes which are overridden by children
    And there are the following work packages in project "ecookbook":
      | subject | type   | status  | fixed_version | priority | done_ratio | estimated_hours | start_date | due_date   |
      | child   | Phase1 | status1 | version1      | prio2    | 50         | 5               | 2015-10-01 | 2015-10-30 |
      | parent  |        |         |               |          | 0          |                 |            |            |
    Given the work package "parent" has the following children:
      | child |
    When I go to the edit page of the work package "parent"
    And I click the edit work package button
    Then the work package should be shown with the following values:
      | Subject        | parent                   |
    And there should not be a "Progress \(%\)" field
    And there should not be a "Start date" field
    And there should not be a "End date" field
    And there should not be a "Estimated time" field
