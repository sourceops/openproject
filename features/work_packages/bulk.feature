    And  I open the context menu on the work packages:
      | pe1 |
      | pe2 |
    And I hover over ".fixed_version .context_item"
    And I follow "none" within "#work-package-context-menu"
    Then I should see "Successful update"
    And I follow "pe1"
    And I should see "deleted (version1)"
